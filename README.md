Build a workout tracker. You have already been provided with the front end code in the `Develop` folder. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
